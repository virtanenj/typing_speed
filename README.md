# typing_speed

Simple terminal based application to train your typing speed (currently only on Finnish) and track your progress.

It uses the kotus-sanalista that is a list of 94110 Finnish words that is supposed to be good representation of the words in Finnish language. Same kind of list is to be added for English.

To improve this, one could save the data on what kind of words are written correctly and incorrectly. Later the program would give to write that kind of words that have been written incorrectly.
